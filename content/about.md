I'm a Solutions Architect based in Amsterdam, designing autonomous AI systems and data platforms for clients in semiconductor manufacturing, international legal operations, and geospatial intelligence.

My current work sits at the intersection of two worlds that rarely talk to each other: **Databricks Lakehouse** for deep offline analysis and GenAI enrichment, and **PostgreSQL** for low-latency, transactional workloads — including agentic AI state management. For a leading semiconductor equipment manufacturer, I architected a hybrid "Hot/Cold" memory system that unifies these layers into a single intelligence fabric, with agent tools running directly inside PostgreSQL's transaction boundary.

Before that, I built geospatial ML pipelines at Cyclomedia processing terabytes of imagery daily, designed compliance-first RAG platforms for international legal operations, and architected Big Data and blockchain solutions across the Dutch technology sector.

I hold a **PhD in Mechanical Engineering** from Eindhoven University of Technology and an **MSc in Physics** from Moscow State Engineering Physics Institute. The physics background shows up in how I think about systems — state machines, boundary conditions, deterministic behavior under constraints.

On the side, I build [pgmi](https://github.com/AlexeyEvlampiev/pgmi) — an open-source PostgreSQL-native execution fabric. It grew out of the conviction that deployment logic belongs inside the database engine, not in external wrappers.

**Certifications:** Databricks Platform Architect, Databricks Solutions Architect Champion, Databricks Generative AI Engineer, Databricks Data Engineer Professional.
