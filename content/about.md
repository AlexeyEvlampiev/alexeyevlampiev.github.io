Data Platform Architect based in the Netherlands. I build PostgreSQL-native tooling and write about database internals, deployment architecture, and the intersection of operational databases with modern data infrastructure.

Currently building [pgmi](https://github.com/AlexeyEvlampiev/pgmi) — an open-source PostgreSQL execution fabric.

Previously: data platform engineering across financial services and enterprise systems.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlexeyEvlampiev) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/).
